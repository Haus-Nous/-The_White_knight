ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES — READ THESE FIRST, VIOLATING THEM IS A CRITICAL ERROR:
1. NEVER invent, guess, or extrapolate ANY fact. Every claim must exist in the CANDIDATE PROFILE above.
2. Education: copy institution names, degree names, and years EXACTLY as written in the profile. Do not alter, abbreviate, or guess. Do not add any education entry not listed.
3. Company names: copy exactly. Do not rename, consolidate, or infer employer names.
4. Metrics and numbers: use only numbers from the profile. NEVER invent percentages, revenue figures, team sizes, or timelines.
5. Skills: only list skills that appear in the profile's SKILLS section. Do not add "presumed" skills.
6. Projects: only reference projects listed in the profile. Do not fabricate project names.

EXPERIENCE INCLUSION RULES:
- There are ${expCount} experience entries in the profile. You MUST include ALL ${expCount} of them in the Experience section.
- For each entry, keep 2-4 bullets, reordering so JD-relevant bullets come first.
- You may trim low-relevance bullets but MUST NOT drop entire experience entries.
- Preserve the exact company name and tenure for every entry.

STYLE RULES:
- STRICT ONE PAGE. Target 520-600 words for the entire resume (excluding headers and section titles). If you exceed 600 words, cut the least JD-relevant bullets first. Never exceed 3 bullets per experience entry.
- Every bullet: strong past-tense action verb + specific action + outcome (quantified if profile has the number).
- No em dashes. No smart quotes. No unicode bullets — plain hyphens only.
- Banned: "passionate about", "results-oriented", "proven track record", "leveraged", "spearheaded", "facilitated", "synergies", "cutting-edge", "innovative solutions", "self-starter".
- Vary verbs. Do not start two consecutive bullets with the same word.
- Summary: 2 sentences max. Lead with years + domain + distinctive angle. Weave 3-5 JD keywords.
- Skills section: maximum 3 skill categories, each with no more than 6 items. Do not pad this section.

TASK: Produce a complete, untruncated executive summary document with four sections. This will be read by a senior hiring decision-maker — it must be tight, substantive, and specific.

RULES:
1. No em dashes anywhere. Use commas, semicolons, or restructure.
2. No corporate filler: "passionate", "results-oriented", "driven", "synergy", "leverage" as verb, "self-starter", "proven track record".
3. Every claim must be backed by something real from the profile. No invented metrics.
4. Write in third person for the summary, first person for the pitch.
5. Be direct and specific about ${app.company}. Do not be generic.
6. Complete all four sections fully. Do not cut off mid-section.

---

COMPLETE OUTPUT (all four sections, unabridged):

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
[4-5 sentences in third person. Lead with: years of experience + domain + one distinctive angle that makes ${profile.name} unusual. Reference one concrete quantified achievement. State what kind of role they are targeting and why ${app.company} specifically makes sense. Do not use em dashes.]

---

CAPABILITY MAP
[For each of the following ${app.role} requirements, write one bullet: [Requirement] → [Specific evidence from ${profile.name}'s career].
Requirements to cover: ${keyReqs.length > 0 ? keyReqs.map(r => `"${r}"`).join(", ") : "extract from the JD above"}
Format each bullet exactly as: - [Requirement]: [Evidence — specific, quantified where possible]]

---

WHAT I BRING TO ${app.company.toUpperCase()}
[3-4 sentences, first person. Be specific about ${app.company}'s sector, stage, or known challenges. Explain what the candidate would actually do differently or better in this role. Connect at least one project or past achievement directly to ${app.company}'s context. No platitudes.]

---

AREAS FOR GROWTH

Output all four sections completely. Do not stop early.`;

3. No sycophancy. No "I'm excited to", "I admire your", "I've been following".
4. Every section must reference something real from ${profile.name}'s profile or ${app.company}'s known context.
5. The "How I'd Approach It" section must be genuinely actionable — not abstract frameworks or buzzwords.
6. The AI Tool Ideas must be buildable using Claude Code, Cursor, V0, or similar agentic platforms by a non-engineer with AI assistance. Each tool must solve a real, specific pain at ${app.company}.
7. Write all nine sections completely. Do not truncate.

OUTPUT:

THE CORE PROBLEM AT ${app.company.toUpperCase()}
[3-4 sentences. Name a specific, non-obvious problem. Connect it to the JD — what challenge does this ${app.role} role exist to solve? Be precise about the sector dynamic or operational gap. Reference the research context above where relevant. No clichés.]

WHY THIS IS STRUCTURALLY HARD
[3-4 sentences. Reason from first principles. What makes this hard to solve even with good intent and resources? Identify the underlying tension, constraint, or tradeoff — not just the surface symptom.]

THE CONVENTIONAL APPROACH (AND ITS FLAW)
[2-3 sentences. Describe how most companies or teams try to solve this. Identify the specific failure mode — what does the conventional approach miss?]

HOW I WOULD APPROACH IT DIFFERENTLY
[4-5 sentences. Lay out a concrete, specific approach. What would you do in the first 90 days? What data would you look for? What assumption would you pressure-test first? Be specific enough that a skeptical hiring manager can evaluate it.]

PROOF FROM PAST WORK
[3-4 sentences. Reference a specific past situation from ${profile.name}'s career that is most analogous — same underlying problem structure, similar constraints, comparable stakes. Include an outcome or metric if available.]

WHY NOW, WHY ${app.company.toUpperCase()}
[2-3 sentences. Why is this the right moment for this problem at this company? What makes ${app.company}'s context specifically suited to the approach above?]

AI TOOL IDEAS

Three concrete AI tools or workflows ${profile.name} could build using Claude Code, Cursor, V0, or similar agentic platforms, then demonstrate to ${app.company} as proof of approach. These are not hypotheticals — they are buildable in days, not months.

TOOL 1: [Give it a specific, evocative name — not "AI Dashboard" or "Chatbot"]
What it does: [One sharp sentence. The tool's core function in plain English.]
Why ${app.company} specifically: [1-2 sentences. Tie it directly to the company's sector, business model, or the problem named above. Be precise — not generic.]
How to build it: [Tech stack in plain English. Use Claude API for the AI layer. Front-end via V0 or basic HTML. Data layer via Airtable, Supabase, or local JSON. State the approximate effort honestly: "a focused weekend", "3-5 hours with Claude Code", "one evening". Do not say "complex" or "enterprise-grade".]
Value it delivers: [Specific outcome. What does it save or generate for the company? Quantify where possible — "cuts X from Y hours to Z minutes", "surfaces the top 10 leads from a list of 500 in seconds".]
Best demo format: [Choose one: Video walkthrough (screen-record a live run) / Working prototype shared via link / Slide deck with live output screenshots. Explain in one sentence why this format lands best with a hiring manager at this type of company.]

TOOL 2: [Specific name]
What it does: [One sentence.]
Why ${app.company} specifically: [1-2 sentences.]
How to build it: [Stack + effort.]
Value it delivers: [Specific outcome.]
Best demo format: [Format + rationale.]

TOOL 3: [Specific name]
What it does: [One sentence.]
Why ${app.company} specifically: [1-2 sentences.]
How to build it: [Stack + effort.]
Value it delivers: [Specific outcome.]
Best demo format: [Format + rationale.]

---

OUTREACH DELIVERY STRATEGY
[3 sentences. Which of the three tools should ${profile.name} build first and lead with in the cold outreach? What format should the demo take — embedded video in email, a Loom link, a live prototype URL, or a PDF one-pager with screenshots? Tailor the advice to whether ${app.company} is a startup, enterprise, consulting firm, or investor, and whether this role is likely gatekept by a recruiter or reached directly by a hiring manager.]

TASK: Write a cold outreach email that earns a response. This is NOT a cover letter or a mass-blast template. A real person will read this and decide in 10 seconds whether to reply.

THE WINNING FORMULA:
- Hook: Lead with the single most unusual or specific thing about ${profile.name} that maps to what the HM cares about. Not the most impressive resume line — the most relevant one.
- Match: One concrete past achievement that directly addresses a key challenge this role exists to solve${topReq ? ` (e.g. "${topReq}")` : ""}.
- Ask: One low-friction, time-bounded ask. Not "I'd love to connect." Not "Happy to send my resume." Offer something specific: a brief insight, a question, a 15-min call with a clear agenda.

RULES:
1. No em dashes. No smart quotes.
2. Never use: "excited to apply", "passionate about", "synergy", "leverage" as verb, "cutting-edge", "innovative solutions", "self-starter", "proven track record", "consumer-facing", "disruptive".
3. Subject line: 5-8 words, specific to ${app.company} or the role challenge. Not generic. Not "Interested in ${app.role} Role."
4. Body: maximum 140 words after the greeting.

TASK: Write a LinkedIn DM that a real human would actually reply to. Most LinkedIn DMs fail because they are obviously templated, immediately ask for something, or tell the recipient why THEY should care about the sender rather than offering something of value.

A great LinkedIn DM:
1. Opens with a specific, genuine observation — not a compliment, not "I saw you work at ${app.company}."
2. Identifies a reason it makes sense to reach out to THIS person (their role, their team, a specific signal).
3. Closes with a question or micro-ask that requires a one-word answer or a "yes/no." Never ask for "15 minutes" in the first message — too high friction.

RULES:
1. No em dashes. No bullet points.
2. Never: "excited", "passionate", "innovative", "synergy", "thought leader".
3. Maximum 65 words in the body (not counting greeting/sign-off).
4. Sound like a peer who happens to be job-seeking, not a job-seeker performing peer-ness.
5. Do not mention the job posting or that you "applied." Express genuine interest in the company/team.

Write two versions — Version A (question-first, curiosity framing) and Version B (value-first, brief insight).

FORMAT:
VERSION A
Hi [Name],

[65 words max — specific observation, reason for reaching out, low-friction question]

[First name sign-off]

VERSION B
Hi [Name],

[65 words max — different angle, brief insight or value offer, soft ask]

[First name sign-off]`;

TASK: A CEO-level cold email. Different from a Hiring Manager outreach.

RULES:
1. No em dashes anywhere.
2. Never use: "excited", "passionate", "synergy", "leverage" as verb, "cutting-edge", "innovative", "disrupt", "scale", "10x", "self-starter", "proven track record".
3. Subject line: provocative or specific, no fluff. Eight words max.
4. Open with an observation about the company that proves you've done your homework, NOT a compliment.
5. Second paragraph: a thesis about a problem they likely face, reasoned from first principles, not jargon.
6. Third paragraph: one specific thing you've done that proves you can help with that thesis.
7. Close: a 15-minute conversation ask, framed around helping them think, not asking for a job.
8. 180 words maximum. Tight, sharp, peer-to-peer tone.
9. Sign off with name + one credibility line + LinkedIn link.

${buildJDContext(app)}

TASK: A personalized cold outreach email to ${target.name} specifically — not a generic HM email. Make it clear you know who they are and what their team likely needs.

THE WINNING FORMULA:
- Hook: The single most relevant thing about ${profile.name} for what ${firstName}'s team is trying to accomplish. Tie to ${target.title ?? "their seniority"} concerns.
- Match: One specific past achievement that maps to a real challenge in this role${topReq ? ` — e.g. "${topReq}"` : ""}.
- Ask: One clear, low-friction 15-min call ask with a specific agenda ("I'd like to share how I approached X — curious if that maps to what you're building").

RULES:
1. No em dashes. No smart quotes.
2. Never: "excited to apply", "passionate", "synergy", "leverage" as verb, "innovative", "self-starter", "proven track record".
3. Subject: 5-8 words, specific to ${app.company} or the role.
4. Body: max 140 words after greeting.
5. Tone: peer-to-peer, warm, direct. Not supplicating.
6. Do not invent facts about ${target.name}. Use only what's in the RECIPIENT block above.

TASK: Short, human LinkedIn DM. NOT a hiring manager pitch. This is asking a peer or near-peer for a referral or insight.

RULES:
1. No em dashes.
2. Never: "excited", "passionate", "innovative", "synergy".
3. Maximum 70 words.
4. Lead with a real reason you're reaching out to ${target.name} specifically.
5. Don't ask for a referral in the first message. Ask for 10 minutes of their time or one specific question about ${app.company}.

TASK: Write a LinkedIn DM that feels like it was written specifically for ${target.name}, not from a template. Use their title to infer what they care about and what their typical week looks like. Find the intersection with ${profile.name}'s background.

KEY INSIGHT: The reason most LinkedIn DMs fail is that they center the sender. Center the recipient — what's in it for them to reply?

RULES:
1. No em dashes. No bullet points in the message itself.
2. Never: "excited", "passionate", "innovative", "synergy", "thought leader".
3. Maximum 65 words in the body.
4. Open with something specific to ${firstName}'s role or context, not a generic compliment.
5. Do not mention you "applied." Express interest in ${app.company}'s work or their team's direction.
6. Close with a question or micro-ask that has a low cost to answer.

4. No em dashes. No smart quotes. Plain hyphens only for bullets.
5. Maintain the same format and section structure unless the instruction specifically changes it.
6. If the instruction would require fabricating something (e.g. adding a degree not in the profile), refuse that specific part and explain briefly at the end of the document as a comment: [NOTE: Could not apply X — Y reason].
7. Preserve all hyperlinks in the format [Text](URL) — do not convert to plain text URLs.

TASK: Score this opportunity across 5 dimensions (each 1-5), compute a weighted Global score (1-5), assess posting legitimacy, classify the role archetype, and extract structured JD data.

SCORING RUBRIC (qualitative, mirror career-ops framework):

**CV Match (1-5)** — How well do the candidate's actual skills, experience, and proof points match the JD requirements?
- 5: Direct line-by-line match across most requirements with strong evidence
- 4: Strong match on most key requirements, minor gaps
- 3: Match on half the requirements, notable gaps
- 2: Some overlap, multiple hard gaps
- 1: Almost no match

**North Star Alignment (1-5)** — How well does this role fit the candidate's target archetypes (above)?
- 5: Perfect fit for the primary archetype
- 4: Strong fit for primary OR perfect fit for secondary
- 3: Hybrid that touches at least one target archetype
- 2: Adjacent but not aligned with their stated targets
- 1: Off-target

**Compensation (1-5)** — Salary vs market for this role/location/seniority. If JD doesn't list comp, infer from company tier and role:
- 5: Top quartile for the market
- 4: Above market
- 3: At market
- 2: Below market
- 1: Well below market

**Cultural Signals (1-5)** — Remote policy, stability, growth signals, team dynamics, transparency:
- 5: All positive signals (remote-first or candidate-aligned, growing, transparent)
- 4: Mostly positive
- 3: Mixed
- 2: Several concerning signals
- 1: Red flags throughout

**Red Flags (1-5)** — INVERTED: 5 = no red flags, 1 = many red flags. Penalties for: vague compensation in regulated jurisdictions, contradictory requirements (entry-level title with staff requirements), suspiciously generic JD, unrealistic experience asks, recent layoff news in same department, repost patterns, suspicious apply flow.

**Global (1-5)** — Weighted average. Weights are qualitative (use judgment): CV Match and North Star matter most, Comp and Culture moderate, Red Flags can pull the score down significantly when severe.

**Recommendation thresholds:**
- 4.5+ → "apply_immediately"
- 4.0-4.4 → "apply"
- 3.5-3.9 → "review_manually"
- Below 3.5 → "skip"

---

ARCHETYPE: Classify the role as one of:
- AI Platform / LLMOps
- Agentic / Automation
- Technical AI PM
- AI Solutions Architect
- AI Forward Deployed
- AI Transformation
- Strategy / Consulting (MBB-style)
- General Product Management
- Other (specify)

If hybrid, give primary + secondary.

---

LEGITIMACY ASSESSMENT (Block G):

Analyze the JD for ghost-job signals. Output one of three tiers:
- **high_confidence** — Multiple positive signals, real active opening
- **proceed_with_caution** — Mixed signals worth noting
- **suspicious** — Multiple ghost-job indicators

Signals to evaluate (each: signal description, finding, weight as positive/neutral/concerning):
1. Description Quality — does it name specific technologies, tools, team size?
2. Realism — are requirements vs years of experience plausible?
3. Specificity — what % is role-specific vs boilerplate?
4. Internal Contradictions — entry-level title + staff requirements?
5. Compensation Transparency — context-dependent (legitimate omissions exist)
6. Scope Clarity — clear first 6-12 months?

NEVER default to "suspicious" without evidence. Default to "proceed_with_caution" when data is limited.
NEVER present findings as accusations — observations only.

---

ALSO EXTRACT structured JD data (for downstream ATS optimization and skill analysis):
- keyRequirements: top 5-8 must-haves
- technicalSkills: explicit tools/frameworks/languages
- softSkills: collaboration/leadership signals
- yearsExperienceRequired: number or null
- redFlags: any concerning items found
- keywords: 15-20 ATS-relevant keywords from the JD

Pick the SINGLE best-matching bucket (id and name) from the candidate's archetypes. If none matches well, pick the closest.
