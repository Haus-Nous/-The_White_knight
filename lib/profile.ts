    voiceNotes: `WRITING STYLE: Direct, specific, non-corporate. Short declarative openers, longer connective middles. Lead with the substantive claim, then the evidence.

OPENING PATTERNS:
- "[X] years of [domain] work across [companies] have been spent doing exactly what this role asks for: [specific behavior]"
- "What makes this role interesting specifically is [the hard part of the job]"
- "The AI builds are live and working. [Concrete enumeration]."

FIRST PRINCIPLES: Woven naturally as "Approaches every engagement from first principles, breaking each problem back to its economic fundamentals before reaching for frameworks"

NEVER USE: em dashes, "excited to apply", "passionate about", "synergy", "leverage" as verb, "cutting-edge", "innovative solutions", "self-starter", "proven track record", "consumer-facing"

TONE BY AUDIENCE:
- MBB/strategy roles: more formal, structured, less first-person
- AI/product roles: direct, confident about builds, lead with concrete proof
- Chief of Staff: warmer, more about partnership and trust
- VC/fintech: acknowledge domain gap honestly, lead with transferable mechanics`,
